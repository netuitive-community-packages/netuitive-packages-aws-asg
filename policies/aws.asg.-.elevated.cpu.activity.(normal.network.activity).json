    "description": "Increases in CPU activity are not uncommon when there is a rise in network activity. Increased traffic to a server means more work for that server to do. This policy is designed to catch cases where CPU activity is higher than than normal, and said behavior cannot be explained by a corresponding increase in network traffic. It may or may not represent a problem, but it is useful to know about.  This policy will not raise an event if CPU is under 20%.\n\nNote: This policy is the same as the corresponding EC2 policy, but it operates on the average CPU and network utilization across all EC2's in the ASG.",
